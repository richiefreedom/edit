EDIT

This repository is a fork of the ACME-like text editor created by Quentin
Carbonneaux. The home page of the project is here: http://c9x.me/edit/.
Its original repository is also hosted on Quentin's site:
http://c9x.me/git/ed.git.

I made this fork to contribute a new GUI backend based on the Simple
Directmedia Layer v.2. This is a first step on the way to full-functioning
port for MS Windows and other partially POSIX-compliant operating systems.

Looks like SDL2 cannot be used in any multithreaded manner with clean
separation between event handling and drawing: races are possible,
especially during resizing of the main window. So, eventually some
architectural changes to the core of the editor can be required.
